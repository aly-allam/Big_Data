30843,2022-04-03,11:04:22,benitezsucks,@SteveOni3 @fifautcr @MarkOgden_ Mo Salah has scored more goals at Old Trafford in the last 15 months and you don't think he's underperforming? Joel Matip has more PL g/a in 2022 than Rashford. I'm a huge fan of him off the pitch but on the pitch he has been atrocious. His attitude stinks. He's stopped trying.
